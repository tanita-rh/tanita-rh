### Good day! My name is Tanita and I've just entered the final year of my PhD at the Observatory of Geneva in Geneva, Switzerland.

I work on characterising chemical diversity of the intersteallar medium in the Milky Way and in distant galaxies using high resolution absorption-line spectroscopy. In my first first-authored [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00131) we find variations in the chemical enrichment of the neutral ISM in 64 distant galaxies (DLAs between 1.7 < z < 4.2). Currently I'm investigating variations in the chemical enrichment in our home galaxy within 2 kpc of the Sun. This work is based on observations from our [HST/STIS program](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/observing/program-information?id=16750&observatory=HST&pi=1). towards 8 bright stars (ID: 16750, PIs: Ramburuth-Hurt, De Cia, Krogager).
