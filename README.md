### Hello! My name is Tanita and I am currently a Postdoc Fellow based at Wits University in Johannesburg, South Africa, under the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO).

I obtained my PhD from the University of Geneva in October 2024. My research interests are on the chemical diversity of the intersteallar medium in both the Milky Way and in distant galaxies using high resolution absorption-line spectroscopy. In my first paper, [Ramburuth-Hurt et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00131), I find variations in the chemical enrichment of the neutral ISM in 64 distant galaxies (DLAs between 1.7 < z < 4.2). In my second paper, [Ramburuth-Hurt et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18986), I bring my studies back home to the Milky Way and investigate variations in the chemical enrichment within 2 kpc of the Sun. This work is based on observations from our [HST/STIS program](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/observing/program-information?id=16750&observatory=HST&pi=1). towards 8 bright stars (ID: 16750, PIs: Ramburuth-Hurt, De Cia, Krogager). 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking to quantify variations in metallicity in the local interstellar medium using novel synergies between UV spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope and radio observations with MeerKAT
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to properly use GitHub
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how astronomy can be used to make the world a better place (or check out [my article](https://www.astro4dev.org/can-astronomy-make-the-world-a-better-place/#:~:text=Through%20the%20OAD%2C%20projects%20based,and%20social%20and%20environmental%20sustainability.)!)
